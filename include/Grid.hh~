// Header file for Grid class.

// The grid class contains the N*N grid of cells that make up the Sudoku puzzle.
// Normally the grid dimension, gridDim = 9, so 9*9 = 81 cells in total.
//
// The grid is created with a given gridDim.
// The content of cells can be set via the grid. The input must be sanitised to ensure a reasonable puzzle. 
// The grid can be drawn to show the content of the grid.
